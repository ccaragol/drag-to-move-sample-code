Drag To Move Sample Code
========================

            

I was searching for a simple script that allowed me to drag and move objects in an PowerShell using Windows Forms.  Nothing was popping up, so I wrote this quickly and decided I'd place it here in the event that it helps anyone else out.  I use
 the label in this example, simple click the label and drag it to any other part of the form you wish.  Please let me know if it helps you out at all, or if there are any questions you may have.  Also, please let me know if you make a public
 contribution with similar features, I'd love to see it!
